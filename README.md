Some code for checking Ontario covid numbers.

This simply reads from the Government of Ontario's site and provides some simple information about the COVID-19 cases.
Probably the best use of this code would be to check daily changes, or to treat it as code for pulling/cleaning the data to run your own analysis.

The "Days til 100 active cases" feature is primarily a joke and is in no way a prediction.

Stay safe.
